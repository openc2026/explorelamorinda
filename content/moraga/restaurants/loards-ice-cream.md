Loard's is old-school ice cream done right. This isn't artisanal small-batch whatever — it's the kind of ice cream parlor where kids press their faces against the glass and parents remember doing the same thing decades ago.

## The Loard's Experience

Scoops are generous, flavors are classic (with some fun options), and the vibe is pure Americana. After youth sports, after school, after dinner at a nearby restaurant — Loard's is where Moraga families end up.
