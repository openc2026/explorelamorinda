Moraga's dining scene is smaller than Lafayette's, but what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in character. You'll find longtime family-owned institutions, casual spots perfect for after soccer practice, and a few hidden gems that locals guard jealously.

## Local Favorites

- **Chef Chao** — A Lamorinda institution for over 35 years
- **Pennini's / Michael's** — Two restaurants, one location, both excellent
- **La Finestra** — Italian fine dining
- **Town Bakery & Cafe** — Breakfast and baked goods

## Quick Bites

- **Lou's Chicken Shop** — Fried chicken done right
- **Nation's Giant Hamburgers** — Classic burgers
- **Ranch House Cafe** — Diner vibes
- **Loard's Ice Cream** — Old-school scoops, perfect post-dinner stop
- **Si Si Caffé** — Coffee and cafe

## The Moraga Dining Vibe

This isn't a "restaurant row" situation. Moraga's spots are scattered between the Rheem and Moraga shopping centers. Parking is easy, reservations aren't usually necessary (except for La Finestra on weekends), and you'll probably run into your neighbors.
