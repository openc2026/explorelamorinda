La Finestra brings upscale Italian dining to Moraga, opened in 2018 by Chef Assadi after the success of his Lafayette establishment. It's become the go-to spot for special occasions in town.

## The Experience

This is Moraga's answer to fine dining — white tablecloths, careful service, and Italian cuisine that rewards attention. It's where locals go for anniversaries and celebrations.

## What to Order

- Housemade pastas
- Seasonal Italian specialties
- Italian wine selection

## Good to Know

- Reservations recommended, especially weekends
- From the same chef behind a well-known Lafayette restaurant
- Upscale but not stuffy — Moraga casual still applies
- Good date night spot for when you don't want to drive to Lafayette or Walnut Creek
