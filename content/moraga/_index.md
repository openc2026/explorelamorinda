Moraga is the quietest of the three Lamorinda towns — more residential, more spread out, and a little more rural in feel. It's home to Saint Mary's College and some of the area's most scenic neighborhoods.

## The Essentials

- **Population:** ~17,000
- **BART Access:** No (closest: Orinda or Lafayette)
- **Vibe:** Quiet, family-oriented, tucked away

## What Makes Moraga Different

Where Lafayette has a walkable downtown and Orinda has Theatre Square, Moraga has... space. The hills are greener, the lots are larger, and the pace is slower. This is intentional — residents like it this way.

## The Town Center(s)

Dining and shopping split between two centers:
- **Moraga Shopping Center** — Safeway, local restaurants
- **Rheem Shopping Center** — More shops and eateries

It's not walkable between them, but parking is easy and the pace is relaxed.

## Saint Mary's College

The college brings energy, athletics, and one of the most beautiful campuses in the East Bay. Worth visiting even if you're not a student.

## Outdoors

- **Moraga Commons Park** — Summer concerts, playground, community gathering
- **Lafayette-Moraga Trail** — Connects north to Lafayette
- **Rancho Laguna Park** — Equestrian area and open space
- **Surrounding hills** — Scenic drives and hiking access

## Schools

- **Campolindo High School** (excellent reputation)
- **Joaquin Moraga Intermediate School**
- **Strong elementary options**
