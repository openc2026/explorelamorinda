Moraga is Lamorinda's hidden gem — a quieter, more residential community tucked into the hills between Lafayette and Orinda. Home to Saint Mary's College and miles of open space, Moraga offers an escape from suburban bustle while remaining minutes from everything.

## What Makes Moraga Special

- **Saint Mary's College** — Beautiful Spanish-style campus open to visitors, with cultural events and athletics
- **Moraga Commons Park** — Community hub with summer concerts, a skate park, and picnic areas
- **Lafayette-Moraga Regional Trail** — 7.5 miles of paved trail connecting to Lafayette and beyond
