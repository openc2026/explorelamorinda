The Orinda Theatre is more than just a place to watch movies — it's a Lamorinda landmark. Built in 1941, this Art Deco gem has been showing films for over 80 years. The distinctive façade, with its vertical "ORINDA" sign, is one of the most recognizable images in the East Bay.

## The Experience

This isn't a sterile multiplex. The Orinda Theatre has character: Art Deco architecture, a real marquee, and the feeling that you're part of something that's been bringing the community together for generations.

## What's Playing

The theatre shows a mix of:
- First-run Hollywood releases
- Independent and art films
- Special events and classic film screenings

## Make a Night of It

Theatre Square surrounds the cinema with dining and drinks:
- Grab dinner at **Shelby's** before the show
- Drinks at **Fourth Bore Tap Room** after
- Quick bite at **Comelones Tacos** or **Petra**

## Good to Know

- **Parking** is free in the Theatre Square garage (validated)
- The **marquee at night** is worth seeing — peak photo op
- **Smaller screens** than modern multiplexes, but the character is worth it
- Check showtimes online — this is a neighborhood theatre, not a 24-hour operation
- One of the few remaining single-screen-feeling experiences in the Bay Area
