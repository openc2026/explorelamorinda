Moraga Commons is the town's gathering place. With a bandshell, playground, picnic areas, and sports courts, it hosts everything from summer concerts to youth sports to lazy weekend picnics.

## Summer Concert Series

The park's bandshell comes alive during summer with free outdoor concerts. Families spread blankets on the lawn, kids run around, and the community gathers for music under the evening sky. It's small-town America in the best way.
