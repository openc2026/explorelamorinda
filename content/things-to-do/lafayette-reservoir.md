The Lafayette Reservoir is the heart of outdoor recreation in Lamorinda. A 2.7-mile paved loop circles the reservoir, making it perfect for walkers, joggers, and cyclists of all ages. On any given weekend, you'll see families with strollers, serious runners getting their miles in, and retirees enjoying a morning constitutional.

## The Rim Trail Loop

The main attraction: a paved, mostly flat 2.7-mile loop around the reservoir. It's wide enough for bikes and pedestrians to share, with stunning views of the water and surrounding hills. Dogs are welcome on leash.

## Beyond the Loop

For more adventure, several unpaved trails branch off into the surrounding hills:
- **Ohlone Point Trail** — Climbs to views of Mt. Diablo
- **Moraga Trail Connection** — Links to the Lafayette-Moraga Trail

## On the Water

- **Kayak & Pedal Boat Rentals** — Available seasonally
- **Fishing** — Stocked with trout and catfish; California fishing license required

## Picnic Areas

Several picnic areas dot the shoreline, some with BBQ grills. Popular for birthday parties and family gatherings — reservations available for groups.

## Good to Know

- **Parking fee** applies (free for EBMUD passholders)
- **No swimming** — it's a drinking water reservoir
- **Early mornings** are magical — mist on the water, fewer crowds
- **Weekends get busy** — arrive early for parking
- Dogs allowed on leash on paved trails

## Seasonal Tips

- **Late winter/early spring** (Feb-Apr): The hills turn emerald green after rains, and early wildflowers appear on the ridge trails. One of the prettiest times to visit.
- **Summer**: Arrive before 9am to beat the heat and the parking crunch.
- **Fall**: Golden grasses and cooler temps make for ideal hiking.

## Getting There

Main entrance on Mt. Diablo Blvd, about a mile east of downtown Lafayette. The lot can fill up on nice weekends — come early.
