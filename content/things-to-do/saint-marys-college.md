Saint Mary's College brings a touch of classic California collegiate beauty to Moraga. The campus is open to visitors, and it's worth a wander — Spanish Mission-style architecture, palm-lined walkways, and views of the surrounding hills.

## What to See

### The Chapel
The heart of campus, architecturally and spiritually. The Spanish Mission-style chapel is beautiful and typically open to visitors during the day.

### The Grounds
Wander the palm-lined paths, admire the mission architecture, and enjoy views of the hills. It's a peaceful escape, especially during summer when students are away.

### De La Salle Hall
The main administrative building, an Instagram-worthy example of California mission architecture.

## Gaels Athletics
