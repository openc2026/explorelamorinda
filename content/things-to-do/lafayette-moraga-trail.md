The Lafayette-Moraga Regional Trail is a 7.6-mile paved path connecting Olympic Boulevard in Lafayette to the Commons Park in Moraga. Following the route of an old railroad line, it's flat, family-friendly, and one of the best ways to experience Lamorinda without a car.

## The Route

Starting in Lafayette, the trail winds through residential areas and open space, passing:
- **Lafayette Community Park**
- **Valle Vista Staging Area**
- **Moraga Commons Park** (southern terminus)

The old railroad route means gentle grades throughout — strollers and road bikes handle it easily.

## Trail Users

The paved surface makes this trail accessible to everyone:
- Walkers and joggers
- Cyclists (road and hybrid bikes work best)
- Families with strollers
- Inline skaters
- Dog walkers (leashed)

## Why Locals Love It

It's not wilderness — it's better for certain purposes. The pavement means you can use it year-round, wet or dry. The gentle grade means everyone from kids to grandparents can enjoy it. And it connects two towns, making it actually useful for transportation, not just recreation.
