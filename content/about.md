## Hey, Neighbor 👋

Explore Lamorinda is a passion project by local residents who love these three towns and want to share them with the world.

We're not a corporate media company. We're not funded by the Chamber of Commerce. We're just people who live here, eat at these restaurants, walk these trails, and send our kids to these schools. We built this guide because we wanted something better than Yelp reviews and outdated blog posts.

## Why This Exists

When friends ask "where should I eat in Lafayette?" or "what's Moraga actually like?", we wanted a single place to point them. Something honest, current, and written by people who actually know the difference between Orinda Village and Theatre Square.

## What We Promise

- **Honest recommendations** — We don't take payment for reviews. If we say a restaurant is good, it's because we've eaten there and liked it.
- **Kept current** — Restaurants close, hours change, new spots open. We update regularly.
- **Local perspective** — Written by residents, not SEO content farms.

## What We Cover

- **Restaurants & Cafes** — Where to eat in all three towns
- **Things to Do** — Parks, trails, the reservoir, entertainment
- **Getting Around** — BART, driving, the Lafayette-Moraga Trail
- **Real Estate** — Market overview and trusted local agents
- **The Basics** — What makes each town unique

## Featured Partners

We occasionally feature local businesses and professionals we trust. These are marked as "Featured" and help support the site. We only partner with people we'd actually recommend to friends.
