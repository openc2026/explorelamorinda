Orinda is Lamorinda's western gateway, perched at the mouth of the Caldecott Tunnel. With its rolling hills, winding roads, and stunning views, Orinda feels like a retreat while being just minutes from downtown Oakland. The town has a quiet elegance — think ranch properties, California modern architecture, and residents who've chosen space over density.
