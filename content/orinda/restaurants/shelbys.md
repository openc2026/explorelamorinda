Shelby's anchors Theatre Square's dining scene with upscale American cuisine. It's the spot for a proper dinner before the movies, a business lunch with style, or a date night without driving to Walnut Creek.

## The Experience

White tablecloth territory for Orinda. The menu leans American with touches of California cuisine, and the execution is reliable. It's been a Theatre Square staple for years.

## What People Order

- Seasonal American dishes
- Wine list that complements the menu

## Good to Know

- Reservations recommended for dinner
- Prime location in Theatre Square
- One of the more upscale options in Orinda
- Good pre-theatre timing — they understand the movie crowd
