Orinda's dining scene centers on two distinct areas: the bustling Theatre Square complex downtown and the legendary Casa Orinda just off the beaten path. Whether you're catching a movie, meeting friends for drinks, or celebrating a special occasion, Orinda delivers.

## Theatre Square

The heart of downtown Orinda dining. Grab dinner before a movie at the historic Orinda Theatre, or make an evening of bar-hopping between spots:

- **Shelby's** — Upscale American, great for pre-theatre dinner
- **Fourth Bore Tap Room** — 28 craft beers on tap
- **Comelones Tacos** — Casual Mexican
- **Petra** — Mediterranean, good for quick bites
- **Kibi's Cafe** — Japanese

## The Legend

- **Casa Orinda** — Open since 1932. Fried chicken, steaks, and a step back in time.

## The Orinda Dining Vibe

Theatre Square makes it easy — park once (free validation available) and walk between restaurants, the movie theatre, and shops. Casa Orinda is its own destination, worth the short drive for the history alone.
