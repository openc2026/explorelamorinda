Named for the Caldecott Tunnel (Lamorinda's gateway), Fourth Bore is Theatre Square's craft beer destination. With 28 rotating taps and solid pub grub, it's the spot for catching a game, meeting friends, or grabbing a drink before or after a movie.

## The Beer

28 craft beers on tap, rotating regularly. If you're a beer person, this is your spot in Orinda. The selection leans local and craft-forward.

## Beyond Beer

The grill menu covers the basics well — this is pub food done right, not fancy but satisfying. Good for groups, good for casual nights.

## The Fun Part

The owners also run The Forge Pizza Fire Truck — a 1970 Ford fire truck converted into a mobile wood-fired pizza operation with a char broiler and beer on draft. They cater events. Yes, seriously.

## Good to Know

- Located in Theatre Square — easy to combine with a movie
- Casual, lively atmosphere
- Good for groups and sports viewing
- The tunnel reference: the Caldecott's fourth bore opened in 2013
