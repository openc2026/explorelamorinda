Casa Orinda has been serving Lamorinda since 1932 — that's over 90 years of fried chicken, steaks, and old-school hospitality. This isn't a restaurant trying to feel historic; it actually is historic. Walking in is like stepping back in time.

## The Legend

Few restaurants anywhere can claim nine decades in the same community. Casa Orinda has seen Orinda transform from rural outpost to upscale suburb, and through it all, they've kept serving the same comfort food that made them famous.

## What to Order

- **The Fried Chicken** — This is what they're known for. Don't overthink it.
- **Steaks** — Old-school steakhouse style
- **Cocktails at the Bar** — The bar itself is worth a visit

## The Vibe

Intimate, cozy, and decidedly not modern. Dark wood, warm lighting, the kind of place where regulars have "their" table. It feels like a family-owned Italian-American roadhouse because that's exactly what it is.

## Good to Know

- Reservations strongly recommended (2,700+ OpenTable reviews speak to its popularity)
- Closed Monday and Tuesday
- Not in Theatre Square — it's on Bryant Way, a few minutes away
- Cash and cards accepted
- The kind of place you bring out-of-town guests to impress them with local character

## Local Lore

Ask any longtime Lamorinda resident about the "best fried chicken debate" and Casa Orinda inevitably comes up. Ninety years later, people still argue about whether anyone does it better — which tells you something about just how good it is.
