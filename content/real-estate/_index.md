Lamorinda real estate is among the most sought-after in the Bay Area. Excellent schools, safe neighborhoods, and easy commute access to San Francisco make these communities perennially desirable. Whether you're buying, selling, or just curious, understanding the local market and neighborhoods is essential.

## Market Overview

Lamorinda is a premium market. Expect median home prices well above $1.5 million across all three towns, with significant variation by neighborhood and lot size. Properties typically move quickly, especially those near downtown areas or with good school assignments.

## Neighborhoods by Town

Each town has distinct neighborhoods with their own character:

- **Lafayette** — From the walkable downtown-adjacent areas to sprawling Happy Valley estates
- **Moraga** — Ranch-style properties in the flats to hillside homes with views
- **Orinda** — From Orinda Village near BART to the secluded Sleepy Hollow neighborhood

## School Districts

Schools drive much of Lamorinda's real estate market. The Acalanes Union High School District serves all three towns, while elementary districts vary by location. We break down school assignments by neighborhood in our detailed guides.
