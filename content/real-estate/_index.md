---

Lamorinda's real estate market is competitive, desirable, and not for the faint of heart. Excellent schools, safe neighborhoods, and easy access to San Francisco make these three towns perennial favorites for families and professionals alike.

## The Market

- **Median home prices:** Generally $1.5M–$3M+ depending on location and size
- **Inventory:** Limited — desirable homes move fast
- **Competition:** Multiple offers common on well-priced properties
- **Timing:** Spring and fall are busiest, but homes sell year-round

## Why People Move Here

1. **Schools** — Top-rated public schools in Acalanes Union High School District
2. **Safety** — Consistently low crime rates
3. **Community** — Small-town feel with engaged neighbors
4. **Commute** — BART access and reasonable drive to SF/Oakland
5. **Outdoors** — Hills, trails, reservoirs at your doorstep

## Finding the Right Agent

In a competitive market, your agent matters. Look for:
- Deep local knowledge (someone who knows which streets flood, which neighborhoods are quietest)
- Strong track record in Lamorinda specifically
- Responsiveness — things move fast here
- A network of local connections (inspectors, contractors, lenders)
