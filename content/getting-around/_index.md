One of Lamorinda's great advantages is its accessibility. Two BART stations provide direct service to San Francisco and Oakland, while the County Connection bus network links the three towns. That said, most residents rely on cars for daily life — and understanding parking in each downtown area makes visiting much easier.

## Transportation Options

### BART
Both Lafayette and Orinda have BART stations, making commuting to San Francisco a 25-35 minute ride. The stations offer parking (free on weekends, paid on weekdays) and are the primary transit hubs for the area.

### County Connection
Local bus routes connect the three towns, BART stations, and nearby communities. Route 6 is particularly useful for getting between Lafayette and Moraga.

### Driving
Lamorinda is primarily car-dependent. Highway 24 runs through the area, connecting to I-680 (north/south) and I-580 (toward Oakland). During commute hours, the Caldecott Tunnel can get congested.

### Parking
Each downtown has its own parking quirks — we've got detailed guides for Lafayette, Orinda, and Moraga to help you find a spot.
