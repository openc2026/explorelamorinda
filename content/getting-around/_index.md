Lamorinda is car-oriented but more connected than most East Bay suburbs. Two BART stations, excellent regional trails, and easy freeway access make getting around manageable.

## BART

Two stations serve Lamorinda:
- **Lafayette Station** — Downtown adjacent, good parking
- **Orinda Station** — Theatre Square nearby, first stop east of tunnel

Both are on the **Antioch (Yellow) line**. About 25 minutes to downtown San Francisco.

**Pro tip:** Parking fills up on weekdays. Arrive early or consider drop-off/pickup.

## Driving

### The Caldecott Tunnel
Your gateway to Lamorinda from the west. Four bores carry Highway 24 through the hills. The fourth bore opened in 2013, adding much-needed capacity.

**Traffic patterns:**
- **Morning:** Heavy westbound (toward SF)
- **Evening:** Heavy eastbound (toward Lamorinda)
- **Weekends:** Generally smooth both directions

### Key Routes
- **Highway 24:** Main artery, connects to I-680 and I-580
- **Mt. Diablo Blvd:** Lafayette's main street
- **Moraga Way:** Connects Lafayette to Moraga
- **Camino Pablo:** North-south through Orinda

## Trails (Non-Car Options)

- **Lafayette-Moraga Trail** — 7.6 miles, paved, connects the towns
- **Connects to:** BART stations, regional parks, downtown areas

For committed cyclists, it's possible to bike-commute from Moraga to BART in Lafayette or Orinda.

## The Reality

Most people drive. The towns are hilly, sprawling, and parking is easy. But for recreation, exercise, and occasional errands, the trails and BART make car-free trips possible.

## Key Distances

- Lafayette to Moraga: ~4 miles
- Lafayette to Orinda: ~3 miles
- Lafayette BART to SF (Montgomery): ~25 minutes
- Caldecott Tunnel to downtown Oakland: ~10 minutes
