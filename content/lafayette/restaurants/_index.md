Lafayette's dining scene punches above its weight. The stretch of Mt. Diablo Boulevard through downtown has earned the nickname "Restaurant Row" — and for good reason. From craft cocktails to housemade pasta, casual brunch to white-tablecloth dinners, it's all here.

## The Lafayette Dining Vibe

Park once, walk the strip. Most restaurants cluster along Mt. Diablo Blvd between 1st Street and Dewing Avenue. Evening reservations are smart for the popular spots, but lunch is usually walk-in friendly. Several restaurants offer happy hour — check individual listings for times.
