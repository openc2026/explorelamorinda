Postino has been a Lafayette institution since 1992, housed in a charming Carr Jones-designed historic building in the heart of downtown. The restaurant celebrates Italian-influenced California cuisine, with a focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients and housemade pastas. With over 1,100 reviews and consistently high ratings, it remains one of Lamorinda's most beloved dining destinations.

## What to Expect

The atmosphere is white-tablecloth elegant without being stuffy — warm lighting, exposed brick, and that unmistakable hum of a neighborhood institution. It's the kind of place you go for anniversaries, birthdays, or when you want to impress out-of-town guests. The bar area offers a slightly more casual vibe if you prefer.

Both indoor and outdoor patio seating are available, with the patio being particularly lovely on warm evenings.

## Recommended Dishes

- **Housemade Pastas** — The kitchen excels here; don't skip them
- **Seasonal Risotto** — Changes regularly, always excellent
- **Osso Buco** — Rich, falling-off-the-bone, and perfectly braised
- **Antipasti Selection** — Great for sharing to start

## Lunch at Postino

A more recent addition, lunch service offers a lighter take on the dinner menu — perfect for a civilized midday meal in downtown Lafayette. Same quality, slightly quicker pace.
