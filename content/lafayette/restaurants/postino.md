Postino has been a Lafayette institution since 1992, occupying a beautifully restored historic building in the heart of downtown. The restaurant serves refined Italian cuisine with a focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients and housemade pastas.

## What to Expect

The atmosphere is white-tablecloth elegant without being stuffy. It's the kind of place you go for anniversaries, birthdays, or when you want to impress out-of-town guests. The bar area is slightly more casual if you prefer.
