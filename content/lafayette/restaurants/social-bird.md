Social Bird is one of Lafayette's liveliest dining destinations, bringing an energetic vibe to Restaurant Row. This neighborhood kitchen and bar focuses on sustainable American fare, craft cocktails, and an impressive craft beer and wine selection.

## The Vibe

The dining room buzzes with conversation, but it's the three patios that really shine — perfect for Lamorinda's mild evenings. It's the kind of place where a casual weeknight dinner can easily turn into a few more rounds.

## What to Order

- **Small Plates** — Great for sharing; the menu encourages grazing
- **Craft Cocktails** — The bar program is a highlight
- **Sustainable Proteins** — Thoughtfully sourced meats and seafood

## Happy Hour

Sunday through Thursday, 3pm–5pm. Not available for takeout, so you'll need to come in and enjoy the atmosphere.

## Good to Know

- From the same owners as Esin Restaurant and Revel Kitchen & Bar in Danville
- Reservations recommended for weekend evenings
- Multiple patio options — request outdoor seating when booking
- Lively atmosphere; not ideal for quiet conversations
