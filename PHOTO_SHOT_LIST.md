## TIPS

- **Exteriors are safe** — no permission needed for building facades from public property
- **Avoid identifiable faces** unless you have permission (backs of heads, distance shots are fine)
- **Golden hour** (sunrise/sunset) makes everything look better
- **Cloudy days** are actually good for even lighting
- **Shoot wide AND tight** — get the establishing shot plus details
- **Vertical shots** work great for mobile/social
